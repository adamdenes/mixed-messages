# Mixed-messages

In this first Codecademy project a _message generator_ program was built. Every time a user runs the program, they should get a new, randomized output.

The theme of the project was based on **['Knock-knock'](https://frugalfun4boys.com/knock-knock-jokes-for-kids/)** jokes.

### Project Objectives:
- Build a message generator program using JavaScript
- Use Git version control
- Use command line
- Develop locally on your computer
